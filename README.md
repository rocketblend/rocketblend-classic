# RocketBlend Classic

RocketBlend Classic is a standalone GUI software client that provides management for builds of [Blender](https://www.blender.org/). Written in .Net 6 using [Avalonia](https://avaloniaui.net/).

I've since moved on to [RocketBlend](https://github.com/rocketblend/rocketblend) and taken a different approach to the problem. Please note that RocketBlend Classic is no longer receiving active maintenance and has several unresolved issues and unrefined features. However, it still serves as a solid starting point for anyone seeking to create a similar solution.

## Built Using
